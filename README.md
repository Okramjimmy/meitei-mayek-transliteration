# meitei-mayek-transliteration
Meitei Mayek Transliteration Tool converts Romanized Manipuri text into the Meitei Mayek script. It supports transliterating vowels, consonants, diphthongs, and special characters like Khudam Mayek. This tool helps users easily transform Manipuri text into its authentic script following standard rules.

# MEITEI MAYEK SCRIPT

## Overview

This document describes the Manipuri language written in Meitei (or Meetei) Mayek/script. Meitei Mayek characters are classified into several groups:

- **Mapum Mayek**
- **Lonsum Mayek**
- **Cheitap Mayek**
- **Cheising Mayek**
- **Khudam Mayek (Special Characters)**

Each group has distinct characteristics and rules for usage in the script. The transliteration process from English to Manipuri follows specific mapping rules and character substitutions, making the process more intricate than simple one-to-one mapping.

## Mapping Rules for Transliteration

### Vowel Mapping Rules (with examples)

1. **Vowel 'aa' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "aa" appears at the beginning of a word, it is mapped to ꯑꯥ.
     - Example: `aanok` (speck) → ꯑꯥꯅꯣꯛ
   - **Middle & Final Position**: If "aa" appears in the middle or at the end of a word, it is mapped to ꯥ.
     - Examples: 
       - `angaang` (child) → ꯑꯉꯥꯡ
       - `yaa` (teeth) → ꯌꯥ

2. **Vowel 'a' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "a" appears at the beginning of a word, it is mapped to ꯑ.
     - Example: `atiyaa` (sky) → ꯑꯇꯤꯌꯥ
   - **Middle & Final Position**: If "a" appears in the middle or at the end, it is mapped to null (it is omitted).
     - Examples:
       - `maku` (owl) → ꯃꯀꯨ
       - `aroiba` (end) → ꯑꯔꯣꯏꯕ

3. **Vowel 'u' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "u" appears at the beginning, it is mapped to ꯎ.
     - Example: `upaal` (tree) → ꯎꯄꯥꯜ
   - **Middle & Final Position**: If "u" appears in the middle or at the end, it is mapped to ꯨ.
     - Examples:
       - `achumba` (right) → ꯑꯆꯨꯝꯕ
       - `machu` (colour) → ꯃꯆꯨ

4. **Vowel 'e' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "e" appears at the beginning, it is mapped to ꯏ.
     - Example: `eche` (sister) → ꯏꯆꯦ
   - **Middle & Final Position**: If "e" appears in the middle or at the end, it is mapped to ꯦ.
     - Examples:
       - `chetpa` (tide) → ꯆꯦꯠꯄ
       - `ene` (aunty) → ꯏꯅꯦ

5. **Vowel 'ee' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "ee" appears at the beginning of a word, it is mapped to ꯏ.
     - Example: `ee` (blood) → ꯏ
   - **Middle & Final Position**: If "ee" appears in the middle or at the end, it is mapped to ꯤ.
     - Examples:
       - `Geeta` (person name) → ꯒꯤꯇ
       - `eikhoigee` (ours') → ꯑꯈꯣꯏꯒꯤ

6. **Vowel 'i' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "i" appears at the beginning, it is mapped to ꯏ.
     - Example: `ima` (mother) → ꯏꯃ
   - **Middle & Final Position**: If "i" appears in the middle or at the end, it is mapped to ꯤ.
     - Examples:
       - `ishing` (water) → ꯏꯁꯤꯡ
       - `ishingchaibi` (waterfall) → ꯏꯁꯤꯡꯆꯥꯏꯕꯤ

7. **Vowel 'o' Mapping**
   - **Initial Position**: If "o" appears at the beginning of a word, it is mapped to ꯑꯣ.
     - Example: `oja` (teacher) → ꯑꯣꯓ
   - **Middle Position**:
     - If "o" is the first sound in a syllable, it is mapped to ꯑꯣ.
       - Example: `a-on-ba` (change) → ꯑꯑꯣꯟꯕ
     - If "o" is not the first sound in a syllable, it is mapped to ꯣ.
       - Example: `ki-hom` (pineapple) → ꯀꯤꯍꯣꯝ
   - **Final Position**: If "o" appears at the end of a word or syllable, it is mapped to ꯣ.
     - Examples:
       - `kabo` (name of a place) → ꯀꯕꯣ
       - `ka-bo-kang` (water hyacinth) → ꯀꯕꯣꯀꯪ

## Rules for Lonsum Mayek

1. In a syllable, if a vowel is followed by a character with a lonsum, the lonsum character should be used.
2. Example:
   - Word: `Matam` (time) -> ꯃꯇꯝ

---

## Re-Substitution Rules

1. Replace `ae` in the beginning of a word with ꯑꯦ.

   - Example: `Aekaagaari` (bicycle) -> ꯑꯦꯀꯥꯒꯥꯔꯤ.

2. Replace `y` after a vowel at the end of a syllable with ꯏ.

   - Example: `joychandra` -> ꯖꯣꯏꯆꯟꯗ꯭ꯔ.

3. Replace `y` after a consonant at the end of a syllable with ꯤ.

   - Example: `pony` -> ꯄꯣꯅꯤ.

---

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Reading and Writing**: Always adhere to vowel and consonant placement rules to ensure proper pronunciation and writing.
2. **Numerals**: Use Cheising Mayek for numerical representations in text.
3. **Cultural Context**: Maintain the integrity of the Meitei language by following established transliteration rules.
